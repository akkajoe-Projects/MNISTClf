# MNIST Digit Classification with SGD and Random Forest
This repository contains a comprehensive implementation of digit classification using the MNIST dataset. The MNIST dataset is a large database of handwritten digits commonly used for training various image processing systems. This project demonstrates the step-by-step process of fetching, processing, and classifying the digits using Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) and Random Forest classifiers.
