# MNIST Digit Classification with SGD and Random Forest
This repository contains a comprehensive implementation of digit classification using the MNIST dataset. The MNIST dataset is a large database of handwritten digits commonly used for training various image processing systems. This project demonstrates the step-by-step process of fetching, processing, and classifying the digits using Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) and Random Forest classifiers.
We start by fetching and preparing the dataset, then proceed to implement a binary classifier to identify the digit '5' using a Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) classifier. We evaluate the classifier's performance through cross-validation and explore various metrics such as precision, recall, and the precision-recall trade-off. Additionally, we visualize the ROC curve for both the SGD and Random Forest classifiers. The project extends to multiclass classification using the One-vs-One strategy and enhances accuracy by scaling the input features. Finally, we analyze the results with a confusion matrix, identifying common misclassifications and normalizing the matrix to focus on errors.
